# Smart_Steering_Wheel_Drowsiness_Detection_RaspberryPI_Python_ComputerVision

In this project, we have build a smart steering wheel which will detect the drowsiness and distraction of the drivers during driving.
RaspberryPI and a USB Webcam was used.
Computer Vision concepts are used for this purpose. OpenCV library was used. 
Facial features were detected by calculating the aspect ratio and using the shape predictor data
Apart from this we are using a MQ135 alcohol detection sensor for alcohol intoxication detection for the driver.
Alert will be send to the driver in case of any of the above detected conditions
